            About The Periodical
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
            The publication aims to facilitate a structured and productive dialogue among students on a broad range of subjects, thereby promoting critical thinking and its application through writing. A forum through which students can methodically share their opinions on various aspects, like politics, religion, sports, institutional policies, etc., and respond to each other. During undergraduate studies, it is not important that students publish research articles, but that they learn to think and engage meaningfully, write, and learn to articulate and respond, be that on any subject. Even though good platforms and ways of writing for them do in fact exist, young adults are usually underdeveloped to breach the strict quality barriers of such prestigious forums. A general writing culture would help reduce the gap between our capacities and the high standards of good forums. The Periodical, hence, aims to reduce this gap.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4 mt-4">
            The periodical covers all non-fiction themes such as politics, law, religion, history, science, sports, and all other social sciences. It has several article categories, such as opinion, book review, and response articles. It aims to strike a balance between typical opinion writing that has minimal evidence/support requirements and academic writing that has the highest evidence/support requirements. Therefore, it will accept short to medium-length articles.
