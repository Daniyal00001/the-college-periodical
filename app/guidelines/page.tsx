          <p>
            This type of publication will be attributed to the writer, meaning their name and contact
            details will appear with the article. A biodata file must be submitted.

            should be included. Submissions are reviewed identically as the process is

        <p>
          Two main categories: <strong>opinion</strong> and <strong>book review</strong>. Subcategories expand on
          opinion writing.
        </p>

        <div className="space-y-4 mt-4">
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Opinion Articles</h4>
            <p>
              Opinion articles are supposed to be between the typical opinion writing, which has minimal
              evidence requirements, and academic writing, which has the highest of those requirements.
              Meaning that while not all statements need to be cited, key ideas and arguments need to be.
              It is important to convey that you have formed this opinion from valid, trustworthy, and
              accessible sources, that it is a well-informed opinion others can rely on. As these are not
              full-length articles, they will typically have one central idea and present one argument.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Law Review Articles</h4>
            <p>
              In the scope of this periodical, a law review article is largely a sub-category of opinion
              writing. Additional legal support would, however, be required. It may present arguments in
              favor and/or theoretical or practical, and ultimately take a stance. A law may be reviewed
              at any level: a statute, an act, a section/an article, and so on. Even the phrasing or
              wording of a law or a part of a law can be inspected, for instance, arguing that the current
              phrasing creates certain negative implications, is ineffective, and arguing for an improved
              version of it.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Institutional Review Articles</h4>
            <p>
              While this is an independent publication and not affiliated with any institute, writers may
              comment on policies, frameworks, practices, etc., of their respective institutes, or on
              education overall. This is to encourage discourse on the education sector and institutions.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Book Review Articles</h4>
            <p>
              While a book review might merely be a precis or summary of a book, a good review is not
              merely that. A good review must critically analyze and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses
              of a book or a part of it. For instance, the book attempts to make X argument but falls short
              for Y reasons. It can introduce a different lens to review the book, for instance, that a
              book adopts a modernist framework to analyze nationalism without addressing the challenges
              posed to it by other frameworks, such as ethnosymbolist, and how these challenges weaken the
              book. Furthermore, it may also draw relevance of a book in our time and context, showing the
              strength of the book, or how the book remains limited to only a particular context,
              conveying the limitations of the book.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Response Articles</h4>
            <p>
              Writers may enhance an already published article and provide further analysis in agreement,
              or they may differ. This category is to encourage engagement between writers, whether by
              agreeing or by disagreeing with each other. In any case, the tone and writing should be
              respectful and should be based on logical grounds. Such articles may respond to the articles
              of any category. Generally, a response article will be given preference over an original
              article, given that the latter is not time-sensitive.
